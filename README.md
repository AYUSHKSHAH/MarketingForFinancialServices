## About
DB Bank is a large public sector bank with branches across various cities, offering services such as savings accounts, current accounts, term deposits, personal loans, and home loans. The bank tracks customer personal, social, and economic details, as well as efforts made to achieve campaign success.

Recently, DB Bank conducted a campaign to market their term deposit scheme, primarily through direct phone calls. The campaign's success was determined by whether a client agreed to place a term deposit (target variable: 'yes' or 'no').

## Challenges
The main challenge for bank officials is to target the right individuals for a successful campaign. The marketing team needs to analyze various customer details, such as profession, income, age, education, existing loans, and credit history, to determine their capability to deposit money into the term deposit scheme.
